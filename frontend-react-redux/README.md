# Redux

> "A little boilerplate never hurt anyone"

## Setup

1. Let's install Redux (+ toolkit!). `npm i`:
   - `@reduxjs/tooklit`
   - `react-redux`
   - `redux-logger`

2. Next, let's add two directories to our file structure at the root `/` level. As always, there is some debate around how to properly separate state management logic. Everyone is wrong, so here's how I do it. 
   - `actions`
   - `store`

3. Currently, our `App` component is housing all of the functions that modify the `questions` portion of our `GLOBAL_STATE` object. We are also threading those actions down to the components that need them, which can introduce bugs. Let's clean this up by navigating to `actions` and creating a new file `question_actions.js`.

4. Within `question_actions.js` we build functions to replace the ones currently defined in our `App` component. These functions will be called **Action Creators**, as they will create the commands that will be 
carried out when users attempt to interact with our app. This part can get a little confusing, but remember there is no magic, only JavaScript.

1. Start by building out  `async` functions with the same names as those used in `App`. We will a special function `dispatch` to them as an argument as well as any data generated by our users. `dispatch` will be invoked only upon success of the work we are trying to do with this data. Be sure to handle errors as well!

    ~~~js
      // /src/actions/question_actions.js

      export const fetchQuestions = () => async dispatch => {
        try {
          // on successful fetch of all questions, those questions will need to be added to our Global State.
          dispatch()
        } catch (err) {
            console.log(`${err} - in fetchQuestions`)
        };
      };

      export const submitQuestion = question => async dispatch => {
        try {
          // on successful submission, we will need to send the question to be added to our Global State. 
          dispatch();
        } catch (err) {
            console.log(`${err} - in submitQuestion`)
        };
      };

      export const deleteQuestion = _id => async dispatch => {
        try {
          // on successful request for deletion, we will need to send the question's id to be removed from Global state.
          dispatch();
        } catch (err) {
            console.log(`${err} - in deleteQuestion`)
        };
      };

    ~~~

2. Now, use `createAction` provided by Redux Toolkit to assemble Redux Actions as messenger functions. `createAction` takes a `type` string with a descriptive name of the work that must be done. (e.g. when a user invokes `deleteQuestion`, upon successful deletion, that question must be **removed** from Global State. We will call that action `REMOVE_QUESTION`).

    ~~~js
      // /src/actions/question_actions.js
      import { createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

      const receiveQuestions = createAction('RECEIVE_QUESTIONS');
      const receiveQuestion = createAction('RECEIVE_QUESTION');
      const removeQuestion = createAction('REMOVE_QUESTION');

    ~~~


3. Once created, we will pass our Redux Actions to our `redux-thunk` function `dispatch`. `dispatch` will literally dis·patch (/dəˈspaCH/ 1. send off to a destination or for a purpose.) the return value (`action` object) of our Redux Action to any function listening for it. 

`action` objects containing the `type` string passed to `createAction` and a `payload`, being an object containing whatever argument is passed to the Redux Action function. See examples below:

    ~~~js
      // /src/actions/question_actions.js

      // ...

      // fetchQuestions ...
          dispatch(receiveQuestions()) // => {type: 'RECEIVE_QUESTIONS', payload: {}}
      // ...

      // submitQuestion ...
          dispatch(receiveQuestion(question)); // => {type: 'RECEIVE_QUESTION', payload: {question}}
      // ...

      // deleteQuestion ...
          dispatch(removeQuestion(_id)); // => {type: 'REMOVE_QUESTIONS', payload: {_id}}
      // ...

    ~~~

8. Earlier, we mentioned that return value of the Redux Action passed to `dispatch` will be sent to any functions listening for a `dispatch` to be fired. We call those functions `reducers`, let's build one now.

9.  Navigate to `src/store` and create a file of the same name `store.js`. Here we will build out our `questionReducer`. Where previously we were modifying a `GLOBAL_STATE` object that was essentially just the local state of our `App` component, our `reducer` will modify an object that is created and maintained by Redux. It is easier to explain the following steps within the code itself:  

    ~~~js
      // /src/store/store.js
      import {createReducer} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

      // define our intial state. we decided to go with an object instead of an array this time. 
      const initialState = {
        questions: {},
      };

      // `createReducer` takes `initialState` as well as a callback function that will build the reducer for us. the return value is a switch statement. `builder` is a class passed in automaticaly. 
      const questionReducer = createReducer(initialState, builder => {
        builder
        // add case takes the various `type` strings we created earlier and sets it as `case` for our switch statement. 
          .addCase('RECEIVE_QUESTIONS', (state, action) => {
          // more future-proofing. some logic for adding multiple questions to state will go here later.
          })
          .addCase('RECEIVE_QUESTION', (state, action) => {
            state.questions[action.payload._id] = action.payload;
          })
          .addCase('REMOVE_QUESTION', (state, action) => {
          // `state` takes the place of the `NEW_STATE` object we created when `App` was handling our actions. `state` is a mutable version of the global state object created by redux and is passed automatically by `builder`.
          // `action` is the action object sent out by `dispatch`. As a reminder, it looks like this:
          // {type: `REMOVE_QUESTION`, payload: {_id}}
            delete state.questions[action.payload._id];
            // now we are free to modify our state. the modified state will then replace the current Global State of our application. 
          });
      });
    ~~~

(NB: Notice here that we are only modifying the `questions` portion of our state. Think back to our rudimentary `GLOBAL_STATE` object we created in the last section. Were we to actually build out all of the extra functionality theorized, each key would have it's own reducer in charge of modifying it's values. We call these segments `slices` of state.)

(ASIDE: All reducers are listening to `dispatch` all of the time. Let's say we had a `uiReducer` that managed Dark Mode and for some crazy reason we wanted to turn Dark Mode off every time a question is deleted. We could simply add a CASE `REMOVE_QUESTION` to our uiReducer that would manipulate the `ui` slice of state when that `type` is dispatched.)

10. Now that we have a function `questionReducer` that manages editing our Global State, let's use Redux to fully replace our `GLOBAL_STATE` object in `App` with our `store` (more specifically, the `state` object within our store).

    ~~~js
        // /src/store/store.js
        import {createReducer, configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
        import logger from 'redux-logger';

        // ... reducer logic. if we were to start adding additional slices of state, we'd want to move these into their own reducer files (e.g. /src/store/question_reducer.js) and import them here.


        // we will create a custom handler function that takes a `preloadedState` which we will define later. this object will form the foundation of the Global State managed in our `store`.
        export const configureAppStore = preloadedState => {
          // configureStore takes a single object with several important keys. 
           const store = configureStore({
             // first we pass our reducer(s)
             reducer: questionReducer,
             // next we use a function given to us called `getDefaultMiddleware` such as `redux-thunk` which we discussed earlier and gives us access to `dispatch`
             middleware: getDefaultMiddleware => getDefaultMiddleware()
               .concat(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? logger : []),
              // finally, we pass in our preloadedState object. 
             preloadedState: preloadedState
           })

        return store;
      };
    ~~~

11. WHEW. That was a lot of work. But **REMEMBER** we have done nothing special here, we are simply passing arguments to normal JavaScript functions (most of which we are writing ourselves) and returning/modifying normal JavaScript objects. 

12. Now that we've assembled the function that will create our store, let's give our `App` component access to it. Navigate all the way back to `index.js` and make some slight modifications. 

    ~~~js
        // /src/index.js

        // import our store creator
        import {configureAppStore} from './store/store.js';

        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
          
          // define our initial state with some seed data.
          let initialState = {
            questions: {
              1: {_id: 1, name: 'Vladimir Harkonnen', content: 'Am I the drama?' },
              2: {_id: 2, name: 'Lady Jessica', content: 'Is Paul the Kwisatz Haderach?' },
              3: {_id: 3, name: 'Paul Atreides', content: 'Why are my dreams so sandy?' },
            },
          };
          
          //create an instance of our store
          let store = configureAppStore(initialState);

          // pass our store to our `App` component.
          ReactDOM.render(<App store={store}/>, document.getElementById('root'));

        });

    ~~~

13. Once our `App` has access to our store, let's reconfigure our `App`. Since we want every component to have access to the store without us needing to thread it down to each sub-component, we will use a `Provider` component to wrap our application and pass it `store` directly. 

    ~~~js
    // /src/components/App.js
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
        import QuestionForm from './components/QuestionForm';
        import Questions from './components/Questions';
        import './css_reset.css'
        import './app.css'

        const App = ({store}) => {
          return (
            <Provider store={store}>
              <div className="App">
                <header>RecApp2.0</header>
                <QuestionForm />
                <Questions />
              </div>
            </Provider>
          );
        }

        export default App;
    ~~~

14. As you can see, we've removed all of the logic for creating and updating a `GLOBAL_STATE` variable and replaced it with our `store`. `store` now contains our `state` object and reducers necessary to manipulate the Global State of our application. 

15. There is one task ahead of us. Every component has **access** to the store but we have not, and should not, provide every **Action Creator** and every slice of `state` to every component. We don't hand off power that easily. Instead, we will **connect** each component only to the `state` slices and `dispach`-able Action Creators it uses and pass these objects/functions as props. 

16. For this, we will use a function provided by Redux called `connect` (which just makes **sense**). Let's start by navigating to our `Questions` component and adding a bit of extra code (as we have remained consistent with our naming conventions, little will need to be changed).

    ~~~js
    // /src/components/Questions.js

        // ...
        import { connect } from 'react-redux';

        // RIP `GLOBAL_STATE`, let's instead give this component access to questions directly.
        // we will also remove the export from our Component for now.
        const Questions = ({ questions, deleteQuestion }) => {

          // REMOVE: const questions = Object.values(GLOBAL_STATE.questions);

        // ...
    ~~~

17. That's all we have to change about this component. Though you may be wondering how we will pass `questions` and `deleteQuestion` as props without prop threading. Start by defining functions that will return an object containing only the slices of `state`/**Action Creators** we want to pass as props to `Questions`. We can call these functions whatever we want, but because we are smart, we will be extremely explicit. 

    ~~~js
    // /src/components/Questions.js
        import { deleteQuestion } from '../actions/question_actions'
        // ... Questions component is here

        // since this function manages our state, it will take some argument which we will just assume is the `state` object from our `store` for now.
        const mapStateToProps = state => ({
          // set a key of the variable name passed to `Questions` above, it's value will be the slice itself (as an Array, because we want it to be).  
          questions: Object.values(state.questions); 
        });

        // now we do the same for our **Action Creators**. we've imported only the relevant onces from `question_actions.js` above. our function will take an argument that we will just assume is the `dispatch` function our **Action Creator** needs.
        const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
          // set a key of the variable name passed to `Questions` above, it's value will be a callback function that accepts an argument and makes use of `dispatch`. 
          deleteQuestion: _id => dispatch(deleteQuestion(_id))
        });

    ~~~

18. The functions above will now need to be invoked with the appropriate, but we do not have access to either `state` or `dispatch` from our store. This is where `connect` comes in. I will break this down carefully as to prevent any confusion or attempts at magical thinking. 

  1. First we will invoke `connect` and pass our two mapping functions as arguments.
    ~~~js
    // /src/components/Questions.js
        
        // ...
        connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
    ~~~

  2. Let's imagine an extremely simplified version of connect (this is for illustrative purposes only). Theres nothing magic happening here, in fact. We could make this ourselves and resurrect our `GLOBAL_STATE`
  object if we really wanted to. Which I don't, because I'm as lazy as I am nostalgic. 

    ~~~js
    // react-redux/connect.js

        import {getReduxStore} from 'somewhere_else.js'

        const connect = (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) => {
  
          const state = getReduxStore().state 
          const dispatch = getReduxStore().dispatch

          const slicesOfState = mapStateToProps(state);
          const dispatchableFunctions = mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)

          const props = {...slicesOfState, ...dispatchableFunctions}

          const functionThatPassesPropsToComponent = Component => {
            return Component(props);
          }

          return functionThatPassesPropsToComponent;
        }

    ~~~
  3. Since connect returns a function that expects our `Questions` component as an argument. Let's go ahead and invoke that function immediately and export the resulting **connected** component out of this file.

    ~~~js
    // /src/components/Questions.js
        
        // ...
        export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Questions)
    ~~~
  
  (NB: If these mapping functions grow too large, it may be wise to extract them into a container file and import your Component there)

19. Now proceed to connect our other components in the same way. Keeping in mind that `connect` expects two argumets. If we do not intend on giving a component access to either `state` or **Action Creators** replace either the state or dispatch mapping function arg with `null`.
